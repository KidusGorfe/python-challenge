# python-challenge

Met with Tutor who encourged me to make this section of my code dynamic:

#Winner Announcment 
if TVcharlie > TVdiana:
    if TVcharlie > TVray:
        winner = "Winner: Charles Casper Stockham"
    else:
        winner = "Winner: Raymon Anthony Doane"
else: 
    if TVdiana > TVray:
        winner = "Winner: Diana DeGette"
    else:
        winner = "Winner: Raymon Anthony Doane"

print(winner)

Originally my code was just a print statment that printed out that Diana was the winner of the election
